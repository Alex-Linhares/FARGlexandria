# Fluid Concepts & Creative Analogies

Congratulations you have made it to the center of the intrenet!

This repository has a number of goals:  

    i) we want to collect **all** the (open-source) computational architectures that have been developed in the research in Fluid Concepts & Creative Analogies; from Numbo to Copycat to Tabletop to Letter Spirit, Metacat, Musicat, &tc, alongside the info on how to install and run it;
    ii) we want to collect **all** the literature (unpublished papers, CRCC reports, published papers, Theses, &tc);
    iii) we want to create an online course, and perhaps a collaborative course book, on Fluid Concepts & Creative Analogies (also called "Fluid Concepts", "FARG architectures", "Copycat Architecture", &tc).    
     
    

Welcome!  Join us.  This will be fun.

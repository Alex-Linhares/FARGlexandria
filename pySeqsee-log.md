#Installation 

pySeqsee is developed in python 3, and since I'm running python 2, I installed python 3 Anaconda.  

expectation(s):  
*be able to install pySeqSee and run a sample problem without (major) issues. 

Following https://amahabal.github.io/PySeqsee/howto/howto_index.html 

Since I have cloned the project, I should just type:  

    sudo python3 setup.py install  

And... no apparent errors.  

Install log --> https://github.com/Alex-Linhares/Fluid-Concepts-and-Creative-Analogies/blob/master/PySeqSee-install-log.md  

So, trying to run... 

    farg run seqsee --sequence 2 3 5 7 11  
    
And it runs nicely!  

===============  
Next Step: play around with the BP app:  https://amahabal.github.io/PySeqsee/new_app/create_new_app.html  

So, I run:

    farg create bongard  
    
and... I get errors. Seems like the bongard folder was there all along, and that threw some exception.  








===============  
Next Step: play with other number sequences

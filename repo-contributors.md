# REPO CONTRIBUTORS
---
These are the people who have been contributing to building this library of projects from the Hofstadter school. Please include your name (and a link to yourself in a pull request).

We are not including the original "FARGonauts" here, as **this is different from their scientific work**.  This is more of a Librarian's work, more of an Educator's work, and more of an Scientific Divulgator's work, that people who contribute should have the proper bragging rights. We want to expand the reach of the Hofstadter school of AI with this repository, not advance the science of that school... which could come as a side benefit to our work, of course.

Having said that... notice, however, the first two contributors...

FARG-FUTURE

Here we outline some ideas & documentation towards future Fluid Concepts architectures (or cool applications).  Since 
authors may have very different views of how the architecture should evolve in the future; each author should post their
own stuff in the folder /FARG-Future/[Author-Name].

Multiple long-term projects... Trying to figure out some big questions:  

i) How do SDM & FARG complement each other?  
ii) how does the slipnet emerge from data?  
iii) What is the evolutionary psychology of FARG?  How do Gibson's affordances fit into the overall theory?  See 
also sociologists papers  
iv) What are the limits of human intuition?

And some smaller projects:

* how do KT forms emerge from data? 
* What is the mind's API? how the field of cognitive science could benefit from such an "api"

My first thought here is to run Abhijit's framework and get familiar with it.  Planning to
document every single step and submit pull requests to his project.  

After being fully familiar _as a user_ with it, I would like to implement numbo with the framework 
and see which changes it should need then.  After that, I would like to implement NUMBO and document each step of
the implementation. Then, I would like to implement AndrÃ©ia's thesis.

Bongard problems: Some interesting vids on the lower-level processing that must be accomplished IMO.

I like complex numbers because the world is fractal and I think the brain has got to be good at fractals, whatever that 
may turn out to mean. --> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEjZl2nqcAU

Some promising SW that may be usable:

Cairo 2d graphics library

https://www.cairographics.org/

And some gui stuff, like Tkinter, pyQT, etc.  But this is only necessary if not forking from pyseeqsee

YouTube videos:  

I would like to make some screencasting videos for wider divulgation: 

*Capyblanca (need to find the running screencast) 
*The Challenge of Bongard Problems  
*Metacat, if I can get it running

# how to contribute
---

First of all, let's leave a problem behind us:  

You do **not** have to be someone who has earned the Ph.D. working with Hofstadter:  Hofstadter gracefully conceded the honorable title of "Associate FARGonaut" to me (Linhares), of which I am truly proud.  If you have ideas for exercises, research questions, programming challenges, or something else altogether... please get in touch!  

At this point let us concentrate contributions such as undergraduate exercises, research challenges, in the file [README.md]. As the file becomes too unwieldy, *then* we move over and re-organize into new files.  

Papers should go into the [Literature](/Literature) folder. Pirated copies of Books are not ok; ok guys?

So, how to contribute?  

1. Fork the repo;
2. Make your contributions;
3. Include your name in the file [repo-contributors.md](repo-contributors.md), and place some link to you, please (github, linkedin, whatever) so that people can praise you.
4. submit a pull-request!

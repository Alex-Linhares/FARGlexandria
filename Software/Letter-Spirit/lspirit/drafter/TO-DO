when you get to the Central Loop, on re-draws of bad letters, reject
the order used in drawing them the first time

***

Adj/Drafter TO-DOs:

	1) dots not working great

Examiner:

	1) appears to break on some weirdly loopy parts

General:

	2) draw from either direction
SOLN: swap tip-1s and tip-2s before picking tip-1; also reverse
norm-curve, micro-tricky if it's a bisegment
	1) speed
pick motifs probabilistically favoring shorter ones?
cache Drafter calculations?
	2) loops and dot TOUCHING
* alter touch- and avoid-, after drafting, based on secondary touch norm
	00) how can the drawing go up when tip-2 is down? avoiding
this was the whole point of adding that wrinkle
	1) SPEED (esp. esp. of ADJ motifs) -- bad; caching helps
7/22/99: ADJ about 6:30 to explore BR; DRFT 0:34 to draw a b

	2) NEIGHBORHOODS -- perhaps just a small tie-breaker?
	3) tip-2-looking-ahead -- I put it back; try it

ADJ only

	1) Unfortunately, seems to be a conflict in that Adjudicator
wants to really bias levels for scoring, but not so much for Drafter
or maybe even for building TF with Adjudicator; maybe another
parameter to kludge this?

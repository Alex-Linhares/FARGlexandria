we have THREE! ways of calculating adjusted-level-scores
that is bad

one is defined in
set-adjusted-level-scores
and accessed via
*adjusted-level-scores*
and used in (importance), but nowhere else
this in turn, is used in setting Adjudicator thermostat (and nowhere
else)
range from 1 to 13

the other is defined in
adjusted-level-scores
and accessed by calling that function
and used in
 rule-scores (drafter tip location)
 AND
 tip-nv-match-score (drafter tip location)
 but nowhere else

and draft-level-score is also used 
motif-scores (drafter tip location)
all draft sugars

this should all be reduced to one, if there's no good reason not to,
and computed once per adj/draft run

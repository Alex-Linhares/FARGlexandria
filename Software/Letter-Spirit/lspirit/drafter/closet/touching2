PICKING INITIAL POINTS

ends - quanta/rules
ends - quanta/literal-motifs

ends - quanta/already been used (multiply by zero -- this nukes!)

point:
 point info, touching norms, etc. TIMES
 end-and-point norm score TIMES
 end-quantum score (product of the above)

We WERE multiplying end norm and end-quantum first, and this gave us
one out of a possible two end-norm scores

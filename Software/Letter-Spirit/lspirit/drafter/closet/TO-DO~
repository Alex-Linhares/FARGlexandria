	Add "despairer" codelet to bail out of draftings-gone-awry?

weights need tinkering, for sure
2) new quit mechanism -- quit if norms, including tip-2, are met
3) tip-nvs, rules and literal motifs should influence tip clouds
4) contact norms should be involved
5) curve and contact should be influenced by nvs

***

1) come up with correct norm-nv weights, dependent on levels-full
2) come up with scores for abstract rules and motifs
3) quitting -- one more decision, along with steps; or, every decision
involves a step plus whether to quit or not?
4) draw up the codelets and the stopping condition
5) contact
6) NVs for curve, tips, and contact
7) activations?
8) allowances due to prior failures
9) graduate


codelets and other nonsense

INITIALIZE
curve weight, *nvs*, norms-and-nvs, candidates, pick rules

PER QUANTUM
motifs

CODELETS TO DROP SUGAR FOR
norms+NVs
abstract rules
motifs
curve-path

***

norms+nvs: codelet should work on one dimension
1) identify value for part so far
2) find the highest-reward norms-and-nvs in that dimension whose
 dimension value is greater than the value from (1)
3) punish by 60 minus that amount

***

two weights per candidate:

draw step, but proceed (must draw another quantum afterwards)
draw step and quit

added, as now, to both:
motif, breadcrumb

homing involves *tip-2*; have to extend it to entire cloud of tip-2
possibilities; but then, same for both

rule-enforcer:
 typical rule -- must not be violated with step
 at-least -- must be fulfilled for quit step

norm-nv:
 must not be exceeded with any step; points for best value left
 quit-step: value for exactly this step

AND

for quit, tip2 value added in (or big negative for lack thereof)


***

picking tip-2

abstract rules on ends
NVs on tips

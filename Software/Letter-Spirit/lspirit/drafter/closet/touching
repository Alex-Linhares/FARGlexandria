Pre-draw conditions:

first of many
last (including first of one)
middle of many

Norm:

tip1: touch/no-touch
 decided right away

middle:
 nt -- avoid
 t, and already t'd -- avoid
 t, and haven't yet -- sort of indifferent
   but only to *other-stuff*, not *own stuff*
 2ts -- ?????

tip2: touch or no/touch
 nt -- avoid
 t -- if last, then ~insist
   but only to *other-stuff*, not *own stuff*

***

Also have stuff from previous role fillers which you may need to
touch, or need to avoid

***

for any part, you may have:

tip (#1 or #2): touch or don't touch
middle: touch (maybe twice) or don't touch

and as context, you may have:

own-quanta (don't possibly touch, and heavily discourage crossing)
own-points (ditto, unless loop)

must-touch points
must-touch quanta (somewhere, not everywhere)
  but how to represent the need to touch twice?
  (subtract a counter or place on touch-list twice?)

***

so maybe have list of things to touch, and things not to touch

not to touch
 never touch
to touch
 give small reward for touching when middle of many is drawn
 give large reward when last is drawn
 punish if untouched at quit of last part drawn

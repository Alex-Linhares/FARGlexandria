choice of next quantum:

cont: (breadcrumbs homing rules motifs) norm-potential norm-met 
quit: (breadcrumbs homing rules motifs) norm-met tips


Among CONT choices:
1) norm met should exhibit progress made by, i.e., heading in the
 correct direction (without necessarily getting there)

2) norm potential should punish, severely, choices which exceed bounds

Among QUIT choices:

3) norm met should exhibit a correct final choice; any misses should be
 punished severely

4) tips should favor good tips over bad ones

CONT to QUIT:

5) norm-potential should give CONT steps edge over any but the best QUIT
 steps

6) a complete norm-met for a QUIT step should equal, or just slightly
 exceed the score of a CONT with high potential

7) tips should exert a preference for finishing, all things being equal

opts for 21 over 4 on basis of superior norms-met; BUT, because it is
a finish site, we should dock it points

should we not punish unmet norms for continue-condition?

ought to punish continuting ones not for having tip potential, but for
how much tip potential is available in subsequent steps (reward
according to the latter)

MUST have superior homing/curve to what's there now (e-bowl shortcut)

look, basically, there is no lookahead, and this is a problem (but one
we can work with)

*** role-curve is not quite right
  for e-bowl, doesn't allow the width of that curve (full-right)
  for bisegments, also not right

 ALLOW A WIDER BERTH

*** some things, we're going with winner-takes-all
    other things, we allow things to work in a very gray,
    partial-credit way

    SHOULD BE MORE WTA-ish (e.g. tip-2)

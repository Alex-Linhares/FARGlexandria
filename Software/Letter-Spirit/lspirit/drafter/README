Basic categories of things that influence next-quantum selection:

NORMS + NVs:
curvature -- norm + NVs, laid out after tip selection, not
on-the-fly
size attributes -- height, weight, width
boundaries -- floor, ceiling, left-edge, right-edge
contact -- norm + NVs

ABSTRACT RULES:
ban-rules & at-most rules on the fly
at-least only at the last step

MOTIFS:
recall from TF, based on level, and how far the motif has been
followed so far (if at all), and the size of the motif, even if not
followed so far yet

TIP-2:
may quit if tip-2 location, contact, all norms, and at-least rule have
 all already been satisfied

***

Influence tip selection

Tip norms, obviously + NVs
End norms (further modified by ARs? by motifs?)
boundaries and size norms and NVs

NORMS + NVs: 

***

how to influence SP use by level?
1) select one by level and use it?
 fine, but what about motifs, with the length factor?
 OK, pick motifs by length

***

motif

{height, weight, width} (+NV?)
{floor, ceiling, left-edge, right-edge} (+NV?)
curve (+NV?)

ban-rules & at-most rules (everything but at-least-2)

contact -- self and neighbors (at gridpoints, mid-quanta)

***

basic types of step:

picking a tip's possible locations (literal motifs involved)
picking the initial tip

***

how do you consult TF?

NVs -- could do in advance, or at time NV is checked
 curve could be done in advance by weighted total of possibilities
 other norms I want to do on the fly
Maybe pick a norm, then scan the TF, deepwise, to come up with a fuzzy
vector for score

TWO kinds of considerations, for, e.g., height
 at no point to do want to exceed goal, but to fall short is fine,
usually
 but for the last quantum, you have to meet the goal, and neither fall
short nor exceed

Rules, scan the TF, deepwise, to come up with a fuzzy vector for score

Curve, bisegments and NVs?

endpoints? pick tip1 first, obviously, and maybe throw out candidate
tip2s

Motifs -- level of TF a factor, but so is how long the filler has
followed the motif so far; motif type, I don't think needs to be a
factor

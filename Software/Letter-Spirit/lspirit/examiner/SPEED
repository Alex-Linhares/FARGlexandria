From the "hone"  version:

Seconds per codelet:

Examiner 1.0 was GEM
Examiner 2.0 was JAR, finished in 1997
Examiner 3.0 is JAR, 1998

NG: no graphics
WG: with graphics

E3 graphics cheat by not drawing roles

HORSIE

E2-WG 0.78
E2-NG 0.28
E1-WG 1.39

GOOSIE, COMPILED

E2-WG 0.21
E2-NG 0.066

GOOSIE, UNCOMPILED
E3-NG 0.0067

Based on major-test run of 1/2/99, 90 codelets per second
 Average of 2 seconds per run on camel-humps

E2 had an average of 26 seconds per run, so the E3 optimization gave a
real speedup of 14

E3-WG 0.073

E2 vs. E1, WG, Horsie: factor of 1.8
Goosie vs. Horsie: factor of 4, roughly
E3 vs. E2, NG: factor of 10

E3 vs. E1 (extrapolate): factor of 20
E3-WG-goosie vs. E1-WG-horsie: factor of 20

----

Improvement in number of codelets, E1 to E2, was a factor of 2 to 3.3

This would lead to an overall speedup of 74

camel-humps	98.5	162	u/v/w fixed by outlawing humps on u&v
phases-800	

NOTE! phases-800 actually has phases of 600!


camel-fonts	76.1	933

1/4/99
Note on phases, the camel version (phases keep getting softer), on
runs over 2500 codelets was:
NORMALS 10 of 13
FONTS 30 of 66
MAJORS 2 of 16

The second-coming (resets phases at 2500) is worse on NORMALS, so bag
it.

Let's add norm-viols, trim phases where we can, consider making
sparker pick a random part (still!) and wrap this sucker up.

JAR 1999	95.0%	226.6

I still need to:
 work out bugs with 'w'
 run on FONTs, and try that
 make test set without TRAIN

camel-humps also included shapes to deal with closure, to eliminate
errors where 'o' is the attractor

finally, camel-humps, after fixing w, fixed m by -- and this is an act
of genius -- making its smart-parse just like w's, but rotated 180
degrees

JAR's version of 12/23
is 92.3 % on NORMALS-TRAIN (make testfile out of minus-train, which was
concocted from long-phase), and 72.2% on FONTS, with average of 1027
codelets

Thus, we're at 84.7% overall, to Netrec+'s 79.2% (p. 321 of GEM thesis)

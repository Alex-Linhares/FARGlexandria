ROLE DEF add name

also, I don't think the curve names need the asterisks

rather than:
( (context blah1) (topology type blah2) (norms blah3) )

let's go with :
( (activation-node name) (topology type) (norms blah1 blah2 blah3) )

and, give neighborhood 20 points -- include the 20 explicitly, to make
norm score consistent

subdivide role contact by implicated whole, so the info can be used
equally for role sparking and whole r-roles

WHOLE DEF add name

( (activation-node name) (cat category)
  (abstract-rule-norms (uphold) (violate))
  (roles (r-list) )

r-roles:
just list the roles contained within a whole, then do a check on:
filled, covered, norms.contact

PROBLEM: touching info for roles involved with two wholes doesn't
specify which; left-post gets 20 for m touching, but that's not part
of b1; we'll have to specify the touching appropriate for the whole

so, how to score it?
not filled, not covered, let's whack things to where?
whack 40

max activation with 2 of 3 roles full, before r-roles: 20+40 = 60
max activation with 1 of 3 roles full, before r-roles: 20+20 = 40
max activation with 1 of 2 roles full, before r-roles: 20+30 = 50

touching OK: get the minimum of the role-touching-match?

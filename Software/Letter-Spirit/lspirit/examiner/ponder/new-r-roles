Existing r-roles that will do the trick:

notouch (role, role)
closure (t/f)
touchpoints (role, role, number)
dangle-tip (role)
connect (role, mid/tip)
open (direction)
filled (role)
covered (roles)
point (role, preference (alternates))

I think we can get by with:

contact (role, role, where)

e.g.

contact left-post right-bowl m-t1
contact left-post right bowl t2-t2

MUST INCLUDE notouch AS A POSSIBILITY

Maybe represent this by the tips and mids of each part?

left-post tip1: nothing
left-post mid: right-bowl tip1
left-post tip2: right-bowl tip2

filled (as is)

covered (as is)

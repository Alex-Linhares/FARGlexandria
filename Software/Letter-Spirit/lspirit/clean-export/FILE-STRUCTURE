This directory contains the Scheme files in the implementation of
Letter Spirit, completed by John Rehling, April, 2000.

This README file offers a quick overview of the code.

Most files are needed to run Letter Spirit. Some are purely for the
purposes of testing the program, and those are not required for all
runs.

loader.ss is the only file that needs to be loaded directly. It loads
all the other essential ones (some of the "load" commands are issued
by the files "loader.ss" loads). Thus, the Scheme command
(load "loader.ss")
is the first step (once SXM or Scheme are running) needed to run LS.

The following files are not essential to runs of the full LS program,
and exist for tests, runs of the Examiner only, etc.
demo.ss
evolve.ss            Collects stats
draft-test.ss
model.ss             A non-LS mini-model of creativity
sim.ss               More mini-model
test-loop.ss
tf-test.ss
tf-test2.ss
routines.ss          A loader used in some experiments
lobby.ss             Obsolete version of scratchpad.ss

DATABASES OF GRIDFONTS
fonts.ss             Database of several gridfonts plus test support tools
gridfonts.ss         Database of gridfonts from psych experiment
ls-out.ss            Some LS-generated gridfonts

Used anymore???
get-mystery.ss

ls-load.ss            Loading this loads everything necessary

GUI CODE
display.ss            One function for entering gridletter with SXM GUI
scratchpad.ss         Graphics for LS program
sgl-d.ss              SGL/SXM code by John Zuckerman

OLD GEM FUNCTIONS ONLY SLIGHTLY USED?
bond.ss               Used by Examiner, but minimally
get-mystery.ss        I think this no longer has any essential code
glom.ss               Used by Examiner only when coderack becomes empty
graphics.ss           Examiner-only runs may call this; LS runs do not
gtools.ss             Examiner-only runs call this; I don't think LS does
shaker.ss             99% unused, but a little creeps in

In summary, bond.ss, shaker.ss, and glom.ss are used in very narrow
situations, and they could probably be replaced with something much
slimmer than the 430 lines they now comprise. get-mystery seems to be
unneeded. The two graphics files are not needed by LS-only runs,
although having an Examiner-only mode of running is nice for demos.

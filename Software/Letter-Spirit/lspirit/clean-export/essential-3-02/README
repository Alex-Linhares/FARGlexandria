TO RUN LETTER SPIRIT

Start SXM, which will give you Scheme functionality plus graphics.
If you are going to work around the existing LS graphics, you can
start in regular Scheme, but you will have to figure out a way to turn
off graphics! it is not cliamed that this will be easy.

Load the necessary code simply by loading ls-load.ss
(load ls-load.ss)

Several functions allow different ways of running the program. The
most basic and general is probably to call design-gridfont with
seeds. For example,

(design-gridfont '((4 5 6 7 8 9 22 23 25) (4 5 8 9 14 17 20 22 23
25)))

will take those two gridletters, expressed in terms of lists of
quanta, and start Letter Spirit running on it.

NOTE

Much of this code was written when the Examiner was the only part of
the program that existed. Many functions and variables are
Examiner-only, although their names sound more general than that. For
example, (set! *graphics* #f) does not turn off LS graphics. It turns
off Examiner graphics.

MOST LIKELY SNAGS

1) Graphics.

2) The function set-top-level-value!
   I think some versions of Scheme might not have this function. It is
called about five times in the code, and it is essential to how
activation is spread -- a solution that is very fast in SXM/Chez. if a
workaround is needed, serious attention should be given to maintaining
the speed.

3) Examiner-centrism
   Much of this code was written when the Examiner was the only part of
the program that existed. Many functions and variables are
Examiner-only, although their names sound more general than that. For
example, (set! *graphics* #f) does not turn off LS graphics. It turns
off Examiner graphics.

4) General clutteredness
   The code is basically a mess now. FILE-STRUCTURE describes it in
brief. Comments are present in some places, rare in others. I will
re-organize the code without changing its functionality circa autumn
2001.

big slips = big punish DONE, longer phases DONE, complete tip role
defs, allow one fewer label to spark in later phases DONE, get rid of
inelegant 2-offset in phases DONE, Goodness measure DONE

dimension-punish and longer phases does a bit for correctness, but
mainly just slows things down (how much?)

Adjudicator
compute temperate, save old letter information in Library, do not
focus bridge postings on empty levels, more SP detectors DONE, fewer
bridges DONE, have role-filler [mis]match with Library affect Temperature,
routines for removing bad letter, at-mosts need to be excluded from
several category norm lists DONE

HEY: mismatch with Library affects Temperature; mid-level NVs
currently count too much; importance of motifs depends upon size

gotcha -- did that and more, 3/17/99

NOW -- maybe give temperature reward not only for fillers found in
Library, but even for mirror images (etc?) of fillers in Library?

library fillers: (apply append (map cadr *library*))

Fire up second phase (add bridgebuilders) when coderack is empty from
first phase.

I now envision 5 (?) levels in the Thematic Focus:

1) The individual letter rows. All 26 of them, not pooled anywhere.

Then 4 rows by promotion, with no inherent semantics for what each
does or means (model of pyramid-like memory?). Promotion/demotion is
stoachstic. While running on letter GAMMA, bridges from GAMMA SPs to
existing TF SPs will probabilistically lead to promotion at
cleanup. Bridges from TF to nowhere will probabilistically lead to
demotion at cleanup. Promote easier than demote. (Like offense easier
than defense in football.) Promote/demote same things that lower/raise
temperature. Bridges from GAMMA to nowhere will raise temperature a
little.

Promotion/demotion -- Consider variations on this rule:
 See an SP: 2/3 chance of promotion.
 Miss an SP: 1/3 chance of demotion

2) *two-time-SPs*

3, Etc...) no inherent semantics. 

3) *occasional-SPs*
4) *common-SPs*
5) *frequent-SPs*
6) *universal-SPs*

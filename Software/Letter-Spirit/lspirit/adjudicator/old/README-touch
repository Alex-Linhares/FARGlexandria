Rules-
 #t for a zone, angle or orientation implies that the named feature is
ABSENT in the gridletter, and thus the rule APPLIES

 #t for at-least, at-most implies that the named property DOES APPLY

THEMATIC FOCUS:

	A row for each letter category. This will be all we need to
indicate that an SP has turned up at least once.

	A row to indicate SPs that have turned up at least twice.
	A row for SPs that have turned up "sometimes."
	A row for SPs that are "nearly universal."


Bugs?
	Spark values of loop roles going over 100
	Fixed, but will have to re-test Examiner.
	Also, role-defs are liable to change for a while.

NORM-VIOLATIONS

	OK, lots missing. Namely, the different ways of looking at
them, and all the tip ones, including rotation, and the r-role ones.
	Curve -- OK, now

	Example - Height of SHORT-b
	(height less) (height x-height -> t-height)

	Thus NV-compare (implemented), NV-value, NV-mapping


	ROLE-DEFS -- lots of revision to do here

	Tip NVs: Radial (N, S, E, W). "Altered" (no reference to
direction). Rotation "Clockwise", "Counter-clockwise."

	But WHICH tip? Right tip down, left-tip left, etc.
	Gotta compute the default position of the tip in relation to
the other tip.

	R-role NVs: Should touch and don't. Shouldn't and do (rare, I
imagine).

t1	-	into	diff	+t	+m	diff	diff
m	out-of	-	out-of	diff	+t	+t	+m

mt2	diff	-t	-m	out-of	diff	-	into
2ms	diff	-m	diff	out-of	out-of	out-of	-

touch NVs:

less, minus-t, minus-m, plus-t, plus-m, into, out-of, more, diff

1) Want to super-punish super-bad-NVs without having to list the
egregious errors

Each of the simple features exists along a continuum
When you get a new feature (lookup-or-punish does this now),
 make a list of the norms whose points value is positive
If the simple feature is explicitly in the norms, give that as a score
If not, punish according to how many places away from the nearest norm
 it is

So, if height norms were

short 10
very-short 6
medium 1

the score would go

no-height -punish
very-short 6
short 10
medium 1
tall -punish
very-tall -2*punish

Basic code for this is in new-punish.ss
Need to use it in lookup-or-punish, but for efficiency's sake, wait
until first phase is over
Also need it in curve-score

2) You know what else? Make all the phases twice as long.

3) And, get dirty and go through all the tip and endpoint norms and hack
in everything that should be there

4) And, let the sparker go to work with one less than the maximum number
of labels AFTER the first phase.

5) Refine the weight and curve dimensions

6) Get rid of the icky offset of 2 in phases

Weight and curve refinements done
Everything but (1) and (3) are very easy
(3) is straightforward

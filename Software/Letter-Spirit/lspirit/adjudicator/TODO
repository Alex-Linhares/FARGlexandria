Remember, reverse order is possible

Also, add mirror-relative motifs (easy)

Levels of Enforcement:

Implicit in the Letter Rows: Occurred once.
Three rows of promotions:

Occurs virtually all of the time. (about 18 of 26 or more)

	Keep track of this info how?

Let's say the seeds have SP-X in 5 of 8. Then SP-X's frequency goes:

6 of 9
7 of 10
7 of 11
8 of 12
9 of 13
10 of 14
11 of 15
12 of 16
13 of 17

HEY: Besides motifs, run the first-pass on all the gridletters of an
(entire) font, and do a histogram on the resulting info.

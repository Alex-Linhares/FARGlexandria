hierarchy:

literal -- done
translate -- done, but must reverse via tip-flip

now, for 180-degree operations, you could rotate, reflect, or both
both is like a 180-reflection in the orthogonal dimension

90-degree rotations, with or without reflection

45/135-degree rotations, with or without reflection

translate -- respect all 8 compass directions
180 -- respect N-S, E-W, NE-SW, NW-SE, angles: magnitude and rel. sign
90 -- respect N-S-E-W, NE-SW-NW-SE, angles: magnitude and rel. sign
45/135 -- angles: magnitude and rel. sign

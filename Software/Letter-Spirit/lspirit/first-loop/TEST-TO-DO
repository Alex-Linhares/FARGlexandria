Drafter:

How to present output? 

***

All tests:

Examiner:
correlation analyses with psych data and theoretical matrics
What to make of them? Suggestion: Fess up to the worse correlation
with people, explain why, and chalk it up to the extent to which the
devil is in the details. Cogsci '99 cite on that?

Adjudicator:
tf-dumps: some alternates, maybe, to reveal variety?

Scatterplot of Exam/Adj by fonts

***

changes I'd like to make:

harsher score for touch<->nontouch r-role NVs
fewer bridges in Adjudicator
many fewer when TF has only one level
 maybe have a max based on contents of highest level

***

Drafter:

using standard seeds per gridfont
 multiple generations of each category
 1) a couple/three each for all gridfonts and categories
 2) many for isolated examples






ADJUDICATOR

you failed, because the seeding algorithm only took 4 seeds when there
were 5; make the damn thing score itself!
Mr. Bonerhead also forgot to clean out the TF per run

LOOP TEST, 4:20:20 by my watch

short motifs, and crash-proof Examiner

With Drafter, ought to have mode that looks very impressive,
letter-quality-wise, and then we can show later that it isn't what you
want.

With Adjudicator, just run three
Print:
train-font phase test-letter test-font score-one score-mean-of-three
(1 2 3)

TRAIN sets:

benz-l, benz-r, boat, close, house CDFIQY, CFY, D
hunt4, shorts, slant, snout, st-sq CDFIQY, CFY, D
bowtie, chckmrk, dub-bs, fl-rnch, funtnip FHMTVY, FMY, H
boat, close, fl-rnch, hint4, hunt4 CDFIQY, CFY, D
inters, sabtth, slash, sq-curl, w-arrow CDFIQY, CFY, D

TEST sets:

benz-l, benz-r, boat, close, house AKOXZ
hunt4, shorts, slant, snout, st-sq HLNSU
bowtie, chckmrk, dub-bs, fl-rnch, funtnip KN
boat, close, fl-rnch, hint4, hunt4 EGKPT
inters, sabtth, slash, sq-curl, w-arrow BJLMR

TESTed letters: ABEGHJKLMNOPRSTUY
Letters not TESTed or TRAINed: VW

***

In one of the three full sets,
three phases, times five TRAIN, times five letters, times five TEST
375 lines (two scorings)

Three of these, and one 40% the size
3.4 * 2 * 375 / 5 per multiple choice = 510 data points... good test!

NOTE: This could take weeks to finish!!!
Probably ought to only do the triple thing on one set, to explore the
need for it
Maybe ditto with phases... then we cut run time on the other sets by a
factor of NINE, baby!

big-test:
3 runs, times 5 train, times 5 letters, times 5 test, times 3 phase
1125 runs per slate

Maybe 60 hours!

more reasonable:
1 run, times 5 train, times 5 letters, times 5 test, times 1 phase
125 runs per slate

< 24 hours

The boat intrafont run will show-tf without a being trained. Easily
remedied by adjudicating a and show-tf-ing again. Build this into all
the other tests.

Intrafont on STSQ and Benzene will "do" those two for show-tf.

Other, harder, gridfonts can be done with training on smaller, secure
subsets of the alphabet.

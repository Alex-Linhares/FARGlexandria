Here's the plan:

SEEDED

Test set: Benzene Right, House, Shorts, Snout, Standard Square

For seeded things, use runs c. Jan. 15, in closet/
Revised promotion cutoffs used for runs from scratch

hard-promote seeded tests run 1-27 to 1-29:
 cutoff is 0.33 * (average {prevs + 110}) + 15

Feel free to mention, in thesis, the other tests, and explain why a
general approach does not work for both

easy-promote tests run 1-27 to 1-29:
 cutoff is average {prevs + 70} - 10

no-promote tests run 1-30 to ???

EVALUATE
 re-train TF on the BCEFG seeds
 Exam mean score, Failed-Recs, Adj mean score and SAME (as human
 designer)

SAME, just for hard-promote, with the 15 gridfonts of the larger set
that you possibly can with

ANOTHER TEST for The Five: just the plain Drafter, one shot at
everything. And/or, passes at each character until the Examiner passes
everything.

AND, data points on the scores at every fifty points or so, in the
no-promotion version, to show how scores climb. No new runs
necessary... just new scoring!


***

UNSEEDED, we'll want to get six easy-promote and six hard-promote
 (no-promote makes no sense), and plenty of whichever (easy) is better

***

big run: br-noprom-3000
analyses:

raw # of reject, promote, accept, re-elect

per run:
 quit, category reject, category correct
 for category corrects, score distribution

number of tries per category: mean is obvious, but distribution...

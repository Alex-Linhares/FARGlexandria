With double backslash (5 seeds), I say a cats-accepted threshold of 10
(between 9 and 15)

With standard square (5 seeds), nothing to contradict that
(well one that makes me rather lower the threshold)

With one seed, the right threshold is about 51 or 52, with garbage apt
to seep in


So, let's say at one seed, threshold of 50
With 5, drop it to ten

And leave it at that? Try with intermediate number of seeds

YOU'RE STYLIN'!

So, based on number of seeds, recommend promotion at:

1:	roughly 51
2:	tricky; in one case <49; in another, 50..54
3:	61..64, mid 40s
4:	
5:	7 to 15

***

Big thing is that dissimilar seeds drive up the scores, even if there
are several of them

GOING TO cats-scaled (remember problem of when there are only one or
two example)

Hunt4 (b,v,y): -13 to -22 makes the cut

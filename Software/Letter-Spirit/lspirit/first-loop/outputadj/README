real-test: output lines of final (mid-Nov) adj hard test
brief: TRAIN font, TEST cat, RT/RW of real-test

(RW= WRONG; transposed to make greps easier)

***

Didn't rigrously go through all the graded files of medium-arnv and
thermo-down, but my conclusion is that heavy-arnv is the best

Namely, thermostat changes should be multiplied my 6, and that the
weights for importance of ar, vtv-nv, and rel-nv should be 10-10-1

var-*-graded has the graded (RT/WR) output of variations on the same
test set with 6, 3, or 1 letters in the TRAINing set

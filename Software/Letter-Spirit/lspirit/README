gems contains all of Gary's Examiner files, intact
tinker is an alteration which has a different way of spreading activation.
 It doesn't improve the original any.
supercdlt combines several activation-changing codelets into one to enforce
 a serial order to those operations.
curious is an exploration in the use of top-down processing to guide
 activity in keeping with the parallel terraced scan.
basic freezes things from curious at an acceptable point
examiner is the "final" version
graf uses the new, fast graphics
forShow is for horsie & other SunOS demos of Examiner
goosieDemo is likewise for Solaris
adjudicator was a failed start of what ls-main really is

versions created 5/16/98 to hold 8 JAR versions of the examiner, all
from April 1996 - June 1997

newexaminer holds files used in the 1998 re-tooling of the Examiner

final-examiner was the last version of the Examiner prior to
Adjudicator work

adjudicator holds a tentatively-final version of the Adjudicator

drafter updates the Adjudicator significantly (near-final, 7/15/99)
and sallies forth with a Drafter, tentative as of 7/15/99; of course,
includes Examiner as well

ls-main, in lobby.ss, calls a seed-entering program, but graphics may
not mesh neatly with those in drafter

# Is this thinking?  

This is sort of a one-year project; the idea here is to create a reasonably short youtube video that argues that most of AI isn't thinking... it is either combinatorics or statistics... without some properties: 

1. The system is never confused.. never taking it slow... never looking again trying to get a new perspective... temperature
1. The system has a pre-established order of execution, it never plays around with the problem
1. The system doesn't search for an abstraction / analogies / essence
1. There doesn't seem to be a flow of ideas to explore in the system... while people go from one idea to the other
1. etc

Then, the video should explain a domain like copycat and explain how it works.  The video should push the argument that it is some rudimentary form of thinking, or simulating thinking (presuming there's a difference)... 

This should be something like a one year project.  To heva the video ready in 365 days, we should start by writing the video's script.  In 4 months, we should have a pretty good script.  Then we should ask for help for others to review the script.

# REPOSITORY VERSION


#0.0.8
---
Here is how this repository stands:

- What we yearn for has reached the outer limits of the googleverse.  We have collected the projects that are available across the web (i.e., anyone is able to get this material by googling for it). Our yearnings now take us to the email spamming phase of authors of other projects.

- version 0.0.9 (coming up shortly)
     - This version will include the key references of the Copycat project:  anyone that reads those articles should have a great understanding of what the project is about, what are easy and hard problems, how the architecture is mostly organized and why perception and analogy are inseparable.
- version 0.1.0 (coming up soon)
     - This version will include exercises to be conducted on an undergraduate course, and challenges for graduates students that, if completed sucessfully, could lead to copycat-related original results worthy of publication in AI / cognitive science journals.
